            android:text="• Reaching all children with 2 doses of measles vaccine should be the standard for all national
immunization programmes. In addition to the first routine dose of MCV1, all countries should
add a second routine dose of MCV2 to their national immunization schedules regardless of the
level of MCV1 coverage.\n\n• In countries with ongoing transmission in which the risk of measles mortality remains high,
MCV1 should be given at age 9 months. MCV2 should be given between 15-18 months, as
providing MCV2 in the 2nd year of life reduces the rate of accumulation of susceptible children
and the risk of an outbreak. The minimum interval between MCV1 and MCV2 is 4 weeks.\n\n• Because many cases of measles occur in children aged >12 months who have not been
vaccinated, routine delivery of MCV1 should not be limited to infants aged 9–12 months and
routine delivery of MCV2 should not be limited to infants 15 to 18 months of age. Every
opportunity (e.g. when children come into contact with health services) should be taken to
vaccinate all children that missed one or both MCV routine doses, particularly those under 15
years of age. Policies which prohibit use of vaccine in children >1 year of age, older children and
teenagers should be changed to allow these individuals to be vaccinated.\n\n•In countries with low levels of measles transmission (i.e. those that are near elimination or
verified as having eliminated endemic measles virus transmission) and therefore the risk of
measles virus infection among infants is low, MCV1 may be administered at 12 months of age
to take advantage of the higher seroconversion rates achieved at this age. In these countries,
the optimal age for delivering MCV2 is based on programmatic considerations to achieve the
highest coverage of MCV2 and, hence, the highest population immunity. Administration of
MCV2 at 15-18 months of age ensures early protection of the individual, slows accumulation of
susceptible young children, and may correspond to the schedule for other routine immunizations
(for example, a DTP-containing booster, PCV, or meningococcal vaccines). This measure also
supports the establishment of a policy on immunization and other health interventions in the
second year of life. If MCV1 coverage is high (>90%) and school enrolment is high (>95%),
administration of routine MCV2 at school entry may prove an effective strategy for achieving
high coverage and preventing outbreaks in schools.
\n\n• For programmatic reasons (e.g. to reduce cold storage needs and vaccine wastage), it is
recommended that the same vaccine formulation is used for both routine doses of MCV.
